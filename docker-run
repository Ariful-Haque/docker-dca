docker run -d --name nginx --restart unless-stopped -p 8080:80 --memory 500M --memory-reservation 256M nginx

--resatart
Valid values include:
-------------------
no (default): Never restart the container.
on-failure: Only if the container fails (exits with a non-zero exit code).
always: Always restart the container whether it succeeds or fails. Also starts the container automatically upon daemon startup.
unless-stopped: Always restart the container whether it succeeds or fails, and on daemon startup
unless the container is manually stopped.
-p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT: Publish a container port. This process is necessary to access a
port on a running container. The HOST_PORT is the port that listens on the host machine, and traffic
to that port is mapped to the CONTAINER_PORT on the container.
--memory MEMORY: Set a hard limit on memory usage.
--memory-reservation MEMORY: Set a soft limit on memory usage. This limit is used only if Docker
detects memory contention on the host. Should be lower than --memory
